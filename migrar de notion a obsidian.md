## How to migrate from Notion to Obsidian
### 1. Export your notes in Notion

First, launch Notion and click on the three dots in the top right corner. Click the Export option, and select the Markdown & CSV option. Make sure you choose the “Include Subpages” option. Notion will then download all your images and notes into a zip file containing your notes in Markdown.

### 2. Import your notes into Obsidian

Next, launch Obsidian, where a popup will ask you where to store your notes on startup. Under the “Open folder as vault”, select the Markdown file you downloaded earlier.

### 3. Transfer your images into Obsidian

Next, create a page in Obsidian called Evernote images. Drag all the images in the image folder you downloaded in Notion. If you have a missing picture in your notes, refer to this page and copy-paste the missing image.
