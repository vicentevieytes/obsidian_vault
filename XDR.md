### Threat  
hunting

**Focus the attention of your analysts and cut the time spent analyzing telemetry from multiple security platforms.** Wazuh maps detected events to the relevant adversary tactics and techniques. It also ingests third-party threat intelligence data and allows you to create custom queries to filter events and aid threat hunting.

### Behavioral  
analysis

**Detect and respond to threats based on unusual behavior patterns.** The Wazuh behavioral analysis capabilities involve using advanced analytics to identify deviations from normal behavior, which may indicate potential security threats. These capabilities include monitoring file integrity, network traffic, user behavior, and anomalies in system performance metrics.
